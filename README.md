# Formula1-Dashboard

The top section of the dashboard scrapes the latest news from several Formula 1 web pages and displays them.

The dashboard gives us the option to select any year since 1950 and any driver that raced at least once during that year.

This dashboard display's and compares specific driver's demographic data, drivers standings during a specific season, map displaying the locations of where races took place during that season, a list of the grand prix names in the order of which they took place, fastest lap average speed in comparison with the rest of the drivers throughout that season, pit duration comparison, and average lap duration comparison.

The dashboard also displays historical data such as the top 10 drivers of all time (based on the maximum number of races won), top 15 most used tracks, and top 10 constructors (based on the number of constructor championships awarded).
